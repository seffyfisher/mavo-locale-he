Mavo UI translation in Hebrew
To use, simply include the plugin and then use lang="he" on your Mavo root, or the element.

For more info , look at https://mavo.io/docs/ui/#customizing-text--localization

p.s.
the word "MAVO" in hebrew actually means : "introduction" which makes prefect sense!

--some css fixes for rtl--
